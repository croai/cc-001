## Methodology Note

This archive was compiled exclusively from materials shared directly in a Claude conversation on February 27, 2026 — two days after the event. All statistics, quotes, and attributions are taken verbatim from the shared content. No external sources were consulted. LinkedIn engagement numbers reflect the state at time of sharing and may have changed since.

Where statistics were not explicitly visible in the shared content (e.g., reaction/comment counts on some post-event posts), they have been omitted rather than estimated.
